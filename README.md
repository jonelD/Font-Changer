# Font-Changer
I created this tiny bit of code for my computer engineering friends who are working on their project, which is to build an Arduino printer with unique fonts that randomly change with each word to minimize repetition.
They are able to use their voices with the project's speech-to-text API. There is an ongoing discussion over how to loop the font randomly for each word so I made this code.
