# Font-Changer
I wrote this small piece of code for my computer engineering friends who are currently working on their project, which is to create a arduino printer with custom fonts that randomly changes with each word to avoid redundancy while the software has the speech to text function by using their voice. They are currently considering how to loop the font randomly for each word.
The purpose of this small project is to randomly change every word entered into the input field, which will then be displayed in the paragraph.
